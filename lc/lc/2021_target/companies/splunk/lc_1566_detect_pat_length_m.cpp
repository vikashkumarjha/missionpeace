/*
 * Given an array of positive integers arr,  find a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times.

A pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.

Return true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return false.



Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 consecutive times. Notice that pattern can be repeated k or more times but not less.
