/*
Because the head ListNode can be removed in the end,
I create a dummy ListNode and set it as a previous node of head.
prefix calculates the prefix sum from the first node to the current cur node.

Next step, we need an important hashmap m (no good name for it),
It takes a prefix sum as key, and the related node as the value.

Then we scan the linked list, accumulate the node's value as prefix sum.

If it's a prefix that we've never seen, we set m[prefix] = cur.
If we have seen this prefix, m[prefix] is the node we achieve this prefix sum.
We want to skip all nodes between m[prefix] and cur.next (exclusive).
So we simplely do m[prefix].next = cur.next.

/****************************************************************************

The prefix sum can be stored and retrieved using a hash map. We accumulate the sum (as key), and store its node as value in the hash map. Then, when a sum occurs, we know the interval between two link nodes sum to zero. We can then re-point the previous nodeâ€™s next to the next node which effectively removes the nodes between.
