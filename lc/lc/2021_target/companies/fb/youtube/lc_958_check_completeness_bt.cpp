 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

 * Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is
 * completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
 * possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

/*
 * Use BFS to do a level order traversal,
 * add childrens to the bfs queue,
 * until we met the first empty node.
 *
 * For a complete binary tree,
 * there should not be any node after we met an empty one.
